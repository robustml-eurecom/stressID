See https://project.inria.fr/stressid/ for more information about the project and dataset.

### Feature extraction

The folder ```Feature extraction``` contains the scripts for extracting a plethora of features for physiological signals and audio signals, and the resulting ```.csv``` files. 
See the ReadMe file in that folder (coming soon) for more information, usage instructions, and instructions for video features extraction using ```Ã’penFace```.

### Classification

The folder ```Classification```contains scripts for classifying previously extracted features for physiological, audio and video data. 
See the ReadMe file in the folder (coming soon) for more informations and usage instructions. 

### Using the Data

The notebook ```Loading_data.ipynb``` (coming soon) is an example script for parsing the data available in the StressID dataset.

### Labels visualisation 

The notebook ```Labels_analysis.ipynb``` illustrates the distribution of the self-assessments of the StressID dataset.
